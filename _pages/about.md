I completed my undergraduate studies in Info-Bionics Engineering at Pázmány Péter Catholic University (PPCU) in Budapest, Hungary. I'm currently pursuing my PhD under the shared supervision of Emmanuel Procyk and Matteo di Volo at [INSERM (Stem-cell and Brain Research Institute)](https://sbri.fr/teams/neurobiology-of-executive-functions/) in Lyon, and Gergő Orbán at the [Computational Systems Neuroscience Lab (CSNL)](http://golab.wigner.mta.hu/zsombor-ungvarszki/) in Budapest. My research focuses on understanding the prefrontal neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic decision making by analyzing and modeling behavioral and electrophysiological recordings from rhesus monkeys.

Outside the lab, I enjoy doing sports, learning French, or roaming the Alps.
